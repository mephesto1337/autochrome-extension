# Autochrome tag

Bumped the `autochrome_junk_drawer` extension from
[Autochrome](https://github.com/nccgroup/autochrome) to manifest v3. It should
also improve its performance.

The code was heavily stolen from the Autochrome repository :-).

## TL; DR
1. First build the extension
  ```bash
  ./generate-profile-rules.sh
  ./build.sh
  ```
2. Install it in your autochrome.
